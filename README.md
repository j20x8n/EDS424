EDS424 Introduction to Research Methods
Semester 1, ACY 2024-25
Assessment Task Sheet
Individual Poster (60% of the final grade)
This assessment aims to develop your ability to apply the knowledge of research methods. You will be required choose a research topic in the field of education or psychology, develop two research questions, choose an appropriate design to answer your research questions, generate a fake dataset (or use an existing dataset, or collect your own data), analyze data using what you have learned through the module to answer your research questions, and then create a poster with audio presentations. The assessment accounts for 60% of the module mark. You will have to complete the tasks according to the instructions provided in this task sheet.Learning Outcomes Assessed:      
A.      Develop research questions and differentiate between various research designs to address specific research objectives.
B.   Identify and explain the key components of the scientific method and its application for data collection, such as surveys, interviews, and experiments.
C.   Interpret and present basic data analysis methods for quantitative and qualitative research, such as measures of central tendency and variability, basic inferential statistical tests, thematic analysis and grounded theory.
D.   Conduct ethical research by adhering to institutional and professional ethical guidelines in all stages of the research process.

Task Description
In this task you will choose a research topic and design a study to answer your research questions. You will also need to use an existing dataset (or collect your own data), analyze the dataset to answer your research questions or hypotheses, and create a meaningful poster. The task is divided into several stages:
Stage 1: Research Topic Selection   (Week 1-2)
1. Select a research topic in the field of education or psychology that interests you.
2. Create two research questions or hypotheses.
Stage 2: Research Design (Week 3-7)
1. Choose an appropriate research design for your research questions or hypotheses.
2. Determine the details of research methodology (e.g., decide the samples and sample size, tasks, materials)
3. Choose an existing dataset or collect your own dataset that can answer your research questions or hypotheses. You are also encouraged to collect your own data based on your design (but you should get ethics approval first). Please make the way you get your data clear in the poster.
Stage 3: Data Analysis (Week 8-11)
1. Choose appropriate data analysis methods to analyze the data.
2. If you include quantitative data analysis methods, you should: 1) calculate appropriate summary statistics for the dataset, including measures of central tendency, variability, and shape of distributions, 2) create visual representations of the dataset's summary statistics (e.g. histograms, box plots, etc.), 3) create various data visualizations to answer your research questions. Visualizations can include scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, etc.
Stage 4: Presentation (Week 12-13)
1. A poster with 10-min audio presentations should be created. The presentation should include both your research title, research questions, methods, results, and a summary of findings.
2. If you include quantitative designs, in the results part, you should include descriptive, inferential statistics and data visualizations.
Stage 5: Peer Review and Feedback (Week 13)
1. Each student should provide constructive feedback on a randomly assigned poster and presentation. 
2. Use the feedback to make improvements to your poster and presentation.
Stage 6: Submit Your Final Assessment (Before the deadline)
1. Submit your final poster with 10-min audio presentatio代 写EDS424 Introduction to Research Methods Semester 1, ACY 2024-25Haskell

The research topic is well-chosen, clearly defined, and highly relevant, with a strong and well-articulated justification.
The research topic is innovative, clearly defined, and highly relevant. The justification is insightful, demonstrating deep understanding and original thinking.
Outstanding (90-100) is an exceptional answer that could reasonably be expected from a student at that level of study under the prevailing conditions.
Quality and Clarity of Research Questions and Hypothesis (20%)
Research questions and hypothesis are missing, unclear, or irrelevant
Research questions and hypothesis are present but lack clarity or alignment with the research topic.
Research questions and hypothesis are clear and align well with the research topic, though they may lack depth.
Research questions and hypothesis are well-formulated, clear, and directly aligned with the research topic, demonstrating good understanding.
Research questions and hypothesis are exceptionally clear, well-formulated, and directly aligned with the research topic. They demonstrate a high level of critical thinking and insight.
Application of Appropriate Research Designs (30%)
Research design is inappropriate or not described. No clear methodology is evident.
Research design is appropriate but lacks detail or coherence. Methodology is basic.
Research design is appropriate and well-detailed. The methodology is clearly described and fits the research questions.
Research design is well-chosen, detailed, and coherent. The methodology is robust and well-aligned with the research questions.
Research design is exemplary, with detailed and coherent methodology that is innovative and well-aligned with the research questions. Ethical considerations are thoroughly addressed.
Quality and Clarity of Research Findings (30%)
Research findings are missing, unclear, or irrelevant. Data analysis is absent or inappropriate
Research findings are present but lack clarity or depth. Data analysis is basic or minimally appropriate.
